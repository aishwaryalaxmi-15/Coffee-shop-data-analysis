## Steps & Analysis

### 1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - The data was imported into Excel and cleaned to ensure that missing values were handled and the data was formatted correctly (e.g., Date as a date type).

### 2. **Total Sales Calculation**
   - A new column was added to calculate **Total Sales** using the formula:
     ```
     Total Sales = Price * Quantity Sold
     ```

### 3. **Sales by Product**
   - A **Pivot Table** was created to summarize the total quantity sold for each product. This helped in identifying the best-selling products.

### 4. **Sales Trends Over Time**
   - A **Pivot Table** was used to group sales by **Date**, and a **Line Chart** was generated to visualize how sales varied over time.

### 5. **Customer Type Analysis**
   - A **Pivot Table** was used to compare sales between **Regular** and **New** customers. This helped identify which customer type contributed the most to sales.

### 6. **Payment Method Distribution**
   - A **Pivot Table** was used to calculate the total sales for each payment method (e.g., Cash, Card). A **Pie Chart** was then created to visualize the proportion of each payment method.

### 7. **Product Performance**
   - A **Bar Chart** was created to visualize which products were the top performers in terms of quantity sold.
